# Testing Plan for Underwater Asteroids Game
## 1. Core Game Mechanics Tests
### Submarine (Player) Movement
- **Basic Movement**
- Submarine moves forward when thrust key pressed
- Submarine rotates left/right with rotation keys
- Submarine maintains momentum in frictionless environment
- Submarine wraps around screen edges correctly
### Collision Detection
- **Hitbox Accuracy**
- Submarine collision detection matches visible sprite
- Fish collision detection matches visible sprites
- Torpedo collision detection is precise
## 2. Boundary Testing
### Screen Boundaries
- **Edge Wrapping**
- Test submarine wrapping at all 4 edges
- Test fish wrapping at all 4 edges
- Test wrapping at corners
- Test multiple objects wrapping simultaneously
### Performance Limits
- **Stress Testing**
- Maximum number of fish on screen
- Maximum number of torpedoes
- Maximum number of particle effects
- Frame rate stability under load
## 3. Error Handling
### Input Validation
- **Invalid Controls**
- Multiple simultaneous key presses
- Rapid key press/release cycles
- Invalid key combinations
### Resource Management
- **Memory Testing**
- Memory leaks during long gameplay sessions
- Proper cleanup of destroyed objects
- Asset loading/unloading
## 4. Integration Testing
### System Interactions
- **Component Communication**
- Score system updates correctly on fish destruction
- Level progression triggers correctly
- Power-up system integration
- Sound effect triggering
### Game State Management
- **State Transitions**
- Pause/resume functionality
- Game over condition
- Level restart
- High score saving/loading
## 5. Edge Cases
### Extreme Scenarios
- **Unusual Situations**
- All fish destroyed simultaneously
- Player dies while torpedo in flight
- Multiple collisions in same frame
- Power-up collection during death animation
